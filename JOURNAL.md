## 10/15/2025 - Made a plan  

I decided to scroll through r/mechanicalkeyboards, youtube, and geekhack to find inspiration for my keyboard's layout, mounting style, keycaps, switches, and hardware. 
I settled on a 40% keyboard for portability and also because it looks cute lol. 
I included 5 bindable function or layer keys, to ensure I can still use the same amount of keys a full size keyboard would have, so I'm not stuck without keys such as delete, number keys, function keys, or punctuation. 

I used keyboard-layout-editor.com to make [https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@@_y:1&w:1.5%3B&=Tab%0AEsc&=Q&=W&=E&=R&=T&=Y&=U&=I&=O&=P&_w:1.5%3B&=Bksp%3B&@_w:1.75%3B&=Ctrl&=A&=S&=D&=F&=G&=H&=J&=K&=L&_w:2.25%3B&=Enter%3B&@=Fn1&_w:1.25%3B&=Shift&=Z&=X&=C&=V&=B&=N&=M&=%3C%0A,&=%3E%0A.&_w:1.75%3B&=%2F%2F%3B&@_x:1.5%3B&=Fn2&=Win&=Alt&_a:7&w:2%3B&=&_w:2%3B&=&_a:4%3B&=Fn3&=Fn4&=Fn5](url) ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjM3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--38f444afe312360aceabe170876ca5c7f61b7304/image.png)

This layout lets me use a normal keycap set (I'm thinking I'll go with blank PBT keycaps), so I won't have to source custom sized keycaps just for a one-off project. The right spacebar will be space as normal, but the left one will be either backspace or a layer, depending on how I want to use it when I actually build it. 

I also looked through different mounting styles. The top contenders were: 
- gasket mount | the community seems to love this for the sound and feel of the typing experience
- tray mount | easy to implement and manufacture
- gummy o ring mount | makes cases really simple, no bolts needed

I ultimately decided on a gummy o ring mount, because:
- It allows for a nice typing feel and sound
- Simplicity | the case can be one single milled piece rather than gasket mount's two pieces, and I won't need to source any gasket socks or do weird flexy plate manufacturing
- No bolts needed is a big plus, I don't want to unscrew 4-8 bolts every time I need to tweak something inside

After looking through countless reviews and soundtests on reddit, youtube, and geekhack, I decided on the Keygeek Y3 linear switches. I think I'll enjoy linear, plus the community and sound tests show that they produce a very deep sound due to their special stem. They are also very cheap compared to other "quality" switches, at about $2.40 per 10 switches (which means I only need to purchase around $12 of these for my 43 key layout)

For the case, I really like the aesthetic of a single CNC milled piece of 6061 aluminum or polycarbonate. Polycarbonate seems to be about half the price of aluminum through PCBway, plus it is somewhat see through which I think will give a nice effect. 

I want my keyboard to be USB C, so I'm planning to use the HRO TYPE-C-31-M-12 receptacle mounted to the pcb. I might try mounting the receptacle down lower and having a wire connect the pcb and the receptacle if I have time, because a gummy o ring mount could cause issues if the USB receptacle moves too much around without clearance around the plug. 

I also want the pcb to be hotswappable between switches, because I love the idea of being able to change the sound and feel of the keyboard later if I find other switches I think I would enjoy. I'll have to design the pcb to use the classic Kailh hot swap sockets.
